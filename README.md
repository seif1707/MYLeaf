# MYLeaf
using image processing to enhance feature extraction performance of the extracted data and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used as a classifier. 

This framework was carried out using OpenCV library and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) library for better and
optimized leaf identification framework compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio. 

The obtained results show 90% of classification training accuracy of the nine groups of leaf shape and 70%
testing accuracy. The testing accuracy of 95% of leaf class 1 and lowest testing rate of 59% in
leaf class 9.
